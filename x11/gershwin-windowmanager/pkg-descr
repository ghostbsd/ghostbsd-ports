Gershwin Window Manager is the window manager component of the Gershwin
desktop environment. It combines the WindowManager (from gershwin-uroswm)
and XCBKit components into a unified window management solution.

The window manager provides traditional window management features with
GNUstep/Objective-C integration for the Gershwin desktop.
